The 2025 Zips Racing BSPD features a modular PCB which is mounted onto the vehicle Control Board.
The BSPD's job is to ensure that while the vehicle is braking the motor is not being energized. It does this through the use of a comparator circuit checking the breaking and power output through measuring the breake pressure and current sensor.

The purpose of the module is to allow for the BSPD to swapped out with a version compliant to the European Formula Student rule book for future expandability.
